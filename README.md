- Spain has the lowest delay for movies (2 years) and TV shows (1 year), which could suggest that Spanish viewers have a preference for more recent content.
- Countries like India, UK,USA and France have in general more delay in movies (8 to 6 years) and very less delay in TV Shows (1 to 3 years) indicating preference for recent TV shows and older movies in these 
  countries.
- Japan has a consistent delay (5 to 6 years) in both Movies and TV Shows.
# 📈 Recommendations

- Given the significant investment in content production in the USA and the emphasis on India, Netflix should continue to focus on these markets.
